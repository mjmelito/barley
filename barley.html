<h1>Life of Barley</h1>
<h2>It's his world, we're just living in it.</h2>

<p>
  Hello world, my name is Barley. I'm Matt's furry companion, and 
  when I found out he was learning to code I couldn't wait to have him make me 
  my very own webpage so I can finally understand what he stares at all day on those screens.

  Below are some important things to know about me. If you think you'd like to know more, 
  I've included my contact info at the bottom of the page. Enjoy sniffing around!
