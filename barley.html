  Hello world, my name is Barley. I'm Matt's furry companion, and 
  when I found out he was learning to code I couldn't wait to have him make me 
  my very own webpage so I can finally understand what he stares at all day on those screens.
</p>
<p>
  Below are some important things to know about me. If you think you'd like to know more, 
  I've included my contact info at the bottom of the page. Enjoy sniffing around!
</p>

<h3>Basic Info</h3>

    <li>Full Name: Barley Melito</li>
    <li>Nicknames: Bubs, Bubba, Barley Boy, Big Barley Boy, Barles Charkley</li>

<h3>About Me:</h3>
  <p>
    I am a large but very sweet and well behaved boy. I spend a lot of time napping, and even have my
    very own couch due to the fact that I shed. When I'm not napping I enjoy a nice worn in chew toy 
    (bonus points if it's been used by another dog), long walks so I can sniff every blade of grass, and going to
    the dog park (not to play with other dogs, but to be weird, sit in the corner, and stare at them by myself). I love people and 
    will never refuse a good scratch...be warned, I will attempt to lick your face. I know most basic commands, and am currently learning how to search for items in my home.
